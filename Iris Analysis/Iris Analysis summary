Iris Dataset - EDA Summary
Modules Used:
pandas: For handling data
numpy: For numerical operations
matplotlib.pyplot & seaborn: For creating graphs
sklearn.datasets: To load the dataset

Key Functions / Keywords:
load_iris() – Load the dataset
DataFrame() – Create table from data
head(), info(), describe() – Get basic info
isnull().sum() – Check missing values
corr() – Correlation between features
heatmap(), pairplot() – Visualizations

Output Graphs & Their Insights:
Heatmap (Correlation Matrix)
Shows relationships between features.
Petal length and petal width are strongly correlated.
Sepal width has low correlation with other features.

Pairplot:
Plots every feature against every other.
Setosa species is clearly separated from others.
Some overlap between Versicolor and Virginica.

Histogram / Distribution Plots: 
Show spread of values for each feature.
Petal features show more distinct separation by species.

Boxplot:
Visualizes spread, median, and outliers in each feature.
Helps identify which features vary more between species.

Data Insights:
150 samples with 4 features and 3 species.
No missing values.
Petal features are more useful for classification.
Setosa is easiest to classify based on features.

Conclusion:
The dataset is clean and ready for modeling.
Visualizations clearly show how species differ.
Perfect for learning classification models like KNN, SVM, etc.
