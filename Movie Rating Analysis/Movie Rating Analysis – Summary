Movie Rating Analysis – Summary
This project estimates movie ratings from IMDb reviews based on their sentiment. Instead of using actual numeric ratings, the sentiment label (positive or negative) is used to categorize reviews into rating bands:

Positive sentiment → Estimated rating: 7–10
Negative sentiment → Estimated rating: 1–4

A bar chart is used to visualize the distribution of these estimated ratings.

Key Components Used in the Code:
Pandas (pd):
Loaded and manipulated the dataset.
Created a new column Rating_Estimate based on sentiment.
Counted the number of reviews in each rating range using value_counts().

Lambda Function & Conditional Logic:
Used to apply custom logic when converting sentiment into estimated rating.

Seaborn & Matplotlib:
Created a bar chart to visualize the number of reviews in each rating range.
Styled the plot using seaborn.barplot() and adjusted layout with tight_layout().

Clean Plot Design:
Labels and titles were added for clarity.
A color palette (coolwarm) was used to distinguish between rating categories visually.

Insights:
The dataset shows a balanced sentiment distribution, meaning there's a near-equal number of reviews in both the 7–10 and 1–4 rating ranges.
This indicates a fair mix of both positive and negative movie reviews, useful for training or evaluating sentiment models.
