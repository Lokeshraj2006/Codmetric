Sentiment Analysis Summary Report
Objective
The purpose of this task was to analyze product review texts to identify overall sentiment — positive, neutral, or negative — and derive insights into customer perception.

Methodology
Data Source
The dataset used was a plain text file (test.ft.txt) containing one review per line.

Preprocessing
Converted all text to lowercase.
Removed punctuation using the string module.
Removed stopwords using NLTK's English stopword corpus.
Applied custom preprocessing to clean each review before analysis.

Sentiment Analysis
Performed using the TextBlob library.
Sentiment polarity was used to classify reviews:
Polarity > 0 → Positive
Polarity = 0 → Neutral
Polarity < 0 → Negative

Visualization
A pie chart was created using Matplotlib to visualize the distribution of sentiment categories.

Results
Sentiment	Percentage
Positive	75.3%
Negative	22.6%
Neutral	2.1%

Insights
The majority of the reviews (75.3%) were positive, indicating high customer satisfaction.
A significant portion (22.6%) were negative, which may point to specific issues that need attention.
A small number (2.1%) were neutral, suggesting few customers provided objective or undecided feedback.

Conclusion
The sentiment distribution suggests that overall customer sentiment is highly positive. 
However, the notable proportion of negative feedback indicates potential areas for improvement. 
This analysis can be used to guide product enhancements, customer support initiatives, and overall business strategy.
