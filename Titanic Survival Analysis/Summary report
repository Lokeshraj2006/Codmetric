Objective:
To analyze passenger data from the Titanic dataset and uncover the key factors that influenced survival rates using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.

Key Insights:

Gender and Survival:
Females had a much higher survival rate (~74%) than males (~19%).
This supports the historical "women and children first" rescue policy.

Class Matters:
Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate (~63%), while those in 3rd class had the lowest (~24%).
Indicates socio-economic status significantly influenced survival.

Age Impact:
Children (age < 10) had better chances of survival, especially if traveling in 1st or 2nd class.
Elderly passengers had lower survival rates.

Fare Paid:
Higher fare amounts correlated with higher survival, reinforcing the class-based survival disparity.

Embarkation Port:
Passengers who boarded at Cherbourg (C) had the highest survival rate (~55%).
Those from Southampton (S) had the lowest (~34%).

Family Size:
Moderate family size (2–4 members) increased survival probability.
Solo travelers and large families (7+) had lower survival rates.

Tools & Techniques Used:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern discovery

Conclusion:
Survival on the Titanic was strongly influenced by gender, class, age, and fare. These factors reflect social dynamics of the time, highlighting inequalities in access to safety during disaster situations.
