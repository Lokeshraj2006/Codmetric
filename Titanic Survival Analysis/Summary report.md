## Objective

To analyze passenger data from the Titanic dataset and uncover the key factors that influenced survival rates using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **visualization techniques**.

---

##  Key Insights

### Gender and Survival
- **Females** had a much higher survival rate (~74%) than **males** (~19%).
- This supports the historical **"women and children first"** rescue policy.

### Class Matters
- **1st class** passengers had the highest survival rate (~63%).
- **3rd class** passengers had the lowest (~24%).
- Indicates **socio-economic status** significantly influenced survival.

###  Age Impact
- **Children (age < 10)** had better chances of survival, especially in **1st or 2nd class**.
- **Elderly** passengers had lower survival rates.

### Fare Paid
- Higher **fare amounts** correlated with higher survival.
- Reinforces the **class-based disparity** in survival rates.

###  Embarkation Port
- Passengers from **Cherbourg (C)** had the highest survival rate (~55%).
- Those from **Southampton (S)** had the lowest (~34%).

### Family Size
- **Moderate family size (2–4 members)** increased survival probability.
- **Solo travelers** and **large families (7+)** had lower survival chances.

### Visualisation

## Tools & Techniques Used

- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – Data manipulation and wrangling  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Pattern discovery and insights

##  Conclusion

Survival on the Titanic was **strongly influenced by gender, class, age, and fare**. These findings reflect the **social dynamics and inequalities** of the time, highlighting how access to safety during disasters was unequally distributed.
